A lone paperclip teeters on the edge of a wooden desk, casting a shadow too long for its size. The ceiling hums faintly, a chorus of flickering fluorescent lights and hidden pipes shifting with unseen currents. A rubber band, stretched beyond reason, clings to the base of a ceramic mug half-full of something lukewarm. Somewhere beneath the radiator, a penny rests heads-down, waiting for someone to notice.

Car horns stutter in the distance, blending with the rhythmic tapping of raindrops against a window speckled with fingerprints. A playing card, the Queen of Spades, lies facedown beneath a couch, its edges softened by time and dust. The fridge clicks, then hums, a reminder of something mechanical and inevitable. A missing sock, balled up behind a dresser, dreams of reunions that will never happen.

The elevator dings on an empty floor, doors sliding open to nothing in particular. A receipt, crumpled into the shape of an unspoken thought, flutters near an air vent. Outside, a streetlamp blinks twice and decides against a third. A spoon, long abandoned in the sink, contemplates the weight of the next drop of water, balanced on its curved back like a promise waiting to break.
