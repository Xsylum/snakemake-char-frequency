The amber glow of streetlights flickered against the restless pavement, where scattered leaves whispered forgotten stories. Beneath the towering bridge, echoes of distant footsteps merged with the hum of unseen engines. A hollow breeze tugged at the edges of an abandoned newspaper, its crinkled pages folding over half-read headlines. Somewhere beyond the iron railing, waves lapped methodically against damp concrete, counting time in silent intervals.

In the back of a crowded diner, ceramic cups clinked against saucers as muted conversations wove between the hiss of an overworked espresso machine. A faded menu curled at the edges, its ink smudged from years of careless fingertips. The scent of burnt toast lingered near the register, mixing with the sharper tang of citrus cleaner. Outside, a taxi idled impatiently, the driver tapping a rhythm against the worn leather of the steering wheel.

A single moth circled the exposed lightbulb in a basement storeroom, casting erratic shadows against stacked crates and forgotten furniture. The air smelled of dust and varnish, thick with the weight of time. Somewhere within the maze of wooden shelves, a radio crackled, broadcasting a voice too faint to decipher. The locked door rattled slightly as a draft curled in from the narrow stairwell, tugging at a loose slip of yellowed paper pinned to the wall.
