Velvet ribbons twist around the handle of a wicker basket, forgotten beside an overturned stool. The radio crackles, spitting out half a melody before dissolving into static, while a stray button rolls beneath the table, settling near a shoelace tied in a careless knot. Outside, a plastic bag clings desperately to a chain-link fence, caught between gusts that carry the scent of wet asphalt and distant cinnamon.

In a drawer lined with faded newspaper, a deck of playing cards sits unevenly stacked, one joker missing. The ceiling fan wobbles, its pull-chain tapping a rhythmic complaint against the metal frame. A watch, hands frozen at 2:17, rests atop a pile of receipts, ink faded into near-invisibility. Somewhere in the distance, a dog barks twice, then stops, as if reconsidering its purpose.

Corkscrews and teaspoons lie tangled in a dish rack, their metallic edges catching the dim glow of an overhead bulb. A single balloon drifts along the pavement outside, its tether dragging lazily across the cracks. The wind shifts, and for a moment, everything is stillâ€”except for a single raindrop tracing an uncertain path down the windowpane, hesitating at each imperfection in the glass.
