Brass spoons dangle near a flickering neon sign, humming softly beneath a sky thick with unspoken sentences. Cardboard edges curl against the weight of forgotten raindrops, pressed between the whisper of rubber soles and the impatient honk of a distant truck. In a drawer, marbles rest beside a tangled necklace, their quiet equilibrium disturbed only by the occasional shift of unseen vibrations.

Lamp posts tilt at uncertain angles, their glow swallowed by the murmur of vending machines and the scent of warm almonds. A telephone rings three times before surrendering to silence, its coiled cord swaying slightly in the absent breeze. Beneath a park bench, a crumpled receipt flutters against a lost glove, both bearing the same quiet resignation to timeâ€™s indifferent shuffle.

Paperclips, scattered in uneven constellations, lie forgotten on a windowsill where dust settles like snowfall in slow motion. A half-empty bottle of ink leans against a cracked mirror, reflecting only the curve of a plastic comb missing two teeth. Somewhere, a train whistle breaks the stillness, carrying with it a promise no one remembers making.
